# meli_data_challenge_2020

Here are the main files used for my participation to the [Meli data challenge 2020](https://ml-challenge.mercadolibre.com/). [I ranked 31] (https://ml-challenge.mercadolibre.com/final_results), out of more than 100 (180 in total, but i am not sure the last ones did participate seriously).

This is my first participation to such challenge. I learned a lot and I really enjoyed doing it. I thought I could get a better resultat, but I think it is not that bad for a starter.
